B53 When a word ending with a consonant sound is followed by a word beginning with another consonant sound there is no break between them, although the first consonant sound may change its pronunciation a little to make it easier to move to the next consonant sound: 

- a warm_breeze 
- I've_seen it 
- starting_tomorrow 


Notice also that when a word ending with one of the consonants /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, is followed by a word beginning with a different one of these (or /m/ or /n/), no air is released at the end of the first consonant and there is a smooth change to the second: 

- stop_now 
- heard_tell 
- make_bread
